# Seatwork (Graphs)

1. Given the following directed graph $G$:

   ![graph_g](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HowDoIGitHelp/CMSC57CoursePack/refs/heads/master/Exercises/graph_g.png)

   a. Create the adjacency matrix for $G$

   b. Create the adjacency list for $G$.

2. Given the directed graph $H=(V,E)$ where $V = \{a,b,c,d\}$ and $E = \{(a,b),(c,b),(a,d),(c,d),(d,c),(b,d)\}$,

   a. draw the graph

   b. create the adjacency matrix for the graph

3. Given the adjacency matrix for the undirected graph $I$:

   Column/row $i$ has the corresponding vertex, $v_i$. 
   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0&0&0&1&1\\
   0&0&0&1&1\\
   0&0&0&1&1\\
   1&1&1&0&0\\
   1&1&1&0&0\\
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$
   a. Draw the graph

   b. create the adjacency list of the graph

4. Is graph $G$ strongly connected, weakly connected or disconnected? Why?
5. For graph $H$, is there a path that connects $a$ and $b$? If yes, show one path.
6. Is there a circuit in $I$, if yes show one circuit?
