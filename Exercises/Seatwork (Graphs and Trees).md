1. Provide one Euler circuit from graph G.
2. In graph G, what is the shortest distance from b to d?
3. Provide the following traversals of Tree T: inorder, preorder, postorder.

4. **BONUS**. The requirements for a graph to contain an Euler circuit are that (1) the graph must be connected, (2) every vertex must have an even degree. What are the requirements for it to have an Euler path?
