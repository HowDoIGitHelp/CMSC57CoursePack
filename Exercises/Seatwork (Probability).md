# Seatwork (Probability)

*Show your solutions.*

1. Suppose you're rolling two fair dice, and flipping two fair coins, arrange the following outcomes from least likely to most likely (for each letter, write down the sample space and event space):

   a. The sum of dice rolls are 6 and there are two heads.

   b. Neither of the dice rolls exceed 2* and the two coins have the same outcome.

   c. At least one dice roll is even and the two coins are tails

> *each individual die roll is not great greater than 2
2. Which of the following pairs of events are independent?

   a. $E$: Rolling a number greater than 3 on a dice, $F$: rolling a number an even number on the same dice

   b. $E$: Rolling an tails on a coin, $F$: rolling heads on the same coin,

   c. $E$: Flipping two heads from three coins, $F$, flipping two tails from two coins.

3. Given that 1 in 10 people are left handed. 

   a. What is the chance that from a group of 50 people there are **exactly** 5 left handed people?

   b. What is the chance that from a group of 50 people there are **at least** 5 left handed people?

4. Repetition code is one of the most basic forms of error detection and correction. Repetition code works by repeating each bit $n$-times, so that the incorrect bits are detected and corrected. For example if you transmit the bit `0` with $n=5$, it will be encoded as `00000`. 

   Supposing the message experiences some interference and ends up as `00010`, it can be decoded by majority rule as `0`. 

   Suppose that when transmitting a bit, the probability of error (changing from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1) is $p(f) = 0.2$. 

   a. Given $n=5$, what is the probability of decoding a wrong bit?

   b. What is the minimum value of $n$ you need to choose so that the probability of decoding into the correct bit is at least $0.98$? ($n$ has to be an odd number to properly decide majority)

5. I'm given three sealed unlabeled boxes to choose from called A, B, and C. Suppose these are the contents of the boxes;

   - **Box A** - 213 centipedes, 43 razor blades, 4 spiders
   - **Box B** - 101 centipedes, 43 razor blades, 33 spiders
   - **Box C** - 45 centipedes, 200 razor blades, 50 spiders

   *I choose a box randomly.* 

   *While closing my eyes, I reach my hand in the box.* 

   *I pick something at random.* 

   *My nervous system shuts down so I do not feel what it is.*

   *I open my hand.*

   *A spider emerges.* 

   *It is my worst nightmare.* 

   **What is the probability that the box I picked is Box A, given that the randomly picked object inside turned out to be a spider?** 

6. In a table top role playing game a characters damage is represented using the following example notation: "1d10 + 5". Which means the damage dealt is calculated as the *result of one ten sided dice roll plus 5*. Another example, "2d4+8", which corresponds to *the sum of the result of two 4 sided dice rolls plus 8*. 

7. What is the expected damage of the following attacks?

   a. 1d10 + 5=9.8

   b. 2d4 + 8=13

   c. 4d6 - 3=11
