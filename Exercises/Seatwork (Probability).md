# Seatwork (Probability)

*Show your solutions.*

1. Suppose you're rolling two fair dice, and flipping two fair coins, arrange the following outcomes from least likely to most likely:

   a. The sum of dice rolls are 6 and there are two heads.

   b. Neither of the dice rolls exceed 2* and the two coins have the same outcome.

   c. At least one dice roll is even and the two coins are tails

> *each individual die roll is not great greater than 2

3. I'm given three sealed unlabelled boxes to choose from called A, B, and C. Suppose these are the contents of the boxes;

   - **Box A** - 213 centipedes, 43 razor blades, 4 spiders
   - **Box B** - 101 centipedes, 43 razor blades, 33 spiders
   - **Box C** - 45 centipedes, 200 razor blades, 50 spiders

   *I choose a box randomly.* 

   *While closing my eyes, I reach my hand in the box.* 

   *I pick something at random.* 

   *My nervous system shuts down so I do not feel what it is.*

   *I open my hand.*

   *A spider emerges.* 

   *It is my worst nightmare.* 

   **What is the probability that the box I picked is Box A, given that the randomly picked object inside turned out to be a spider?** 

4. **BONUS**: About 13.5% of Americans are Spanish speakers. While about 94.4% Chileans are Spanish speakers. Supposing you put all Americans and Chileans in one room. You then pick a random person from that room, and that person turned out to be a spanish speaker. Which of the following is more likely?

   - The spanish speaker is American
   - The spanish speaker is Chilean

   And why?
