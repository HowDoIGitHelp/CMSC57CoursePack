## Mode of Delivery

This course will be delivered asynchronously through lecture notes with accompanying lecture videos.
This course can also be found online on UVEC.
We won't always have scheduled zoom sessions but you're free to setup consultation on the scheduled times for this class.

### Enrolling through UVEC

Look for the course [Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science 2](https://uvec.upcebu.edu.ph/course/view.php?id=160) in UVEC and enroll yourself to the course.
Make sure you enroll using the correct enrollment key: `cmsc572026`

### Asking Questions and Scheduling Remote Consultations

I'll try to make myself available for questions most of the time but you'll have a better chance of reaching me during our weekly schedules.
You can schedule consultation as a group. Use that time to ask questions about the lecture or ask for help in answering lab exercises.

You can contact me through sms, email, slack dms, or through discord. You can find ways to reach me at the last section of this guide.

## Course Materials

All of the resources in this course can be found in the course pack. The course pack includes:

- **Lecture Notes** - You'll find these files in the Lecture Notes Folder.
  They come in pdf form and markdown form.
  One of the Lecture notes in particular, Introduction to Linear Algebra, has some gifs that will not be loaded on the pdf files.
  You're better off opening the mark down version of this file (use a markdown viewer to open the md files)
- **Lecture Videos**
- **Seatworks**
